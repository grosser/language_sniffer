# LanguageSniffer

Find out what language a given file is.<br/>
This is a stripped down version of [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist)

 - pure language detection, nothing else ...
 - no dependencies
 - no Github business logic

### Language detection

Most languages are detected by their file extension. This is the fastest and most common situation. For script files, which are usually extensionless, we do "deep content inspection"â„¢ and check the shebang of the file. Checking the file's contents may also be used for disambiguating languages. C, C++ and Obj-C all use `.h` files. Looking for common keywords, we are usually able to guess the correct language.

    LanguageSniffer.detect("lib/language_sniffer.rb").language.name #=> "Ruby"

    LanguageSniffer.detect("bin/language_sniffer").language.name #=> "Ruby"

You can also just pass :content and :path, no need to have a local file.

    LanguageSniffer.detect("xxx/language_sniffer", :content => File.read('bin/language_sniffer)).language.name #=> "Ruby"

See [lib/language_sniffer/language.rb](https://github.com/grosser/language_sniffer/blob/master/lib/language_sniffer/language.rb) and [lib/language_sniffer/languages.yml](https://github.com/github/language_sniffer/blob/master/lib/language_sniffer/languages.yml).
